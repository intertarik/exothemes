# Introduction

## Framework

The product is built using [Pine Email Framework](https://docs.thememountain.com/pine).

If you want to customise layouts, change columns, or do anything that affects structure, besides HTML knowledge we strongly suggest you first read the framework documentation.

The documentation you're looking at now provides template-related guidance only. For anything else, you will find links to the framework documentation, which goes in-depth on code and framework-related topics, and provides practical examples.

## Required Software

#### Code Editing

If you plan on customizing the HTML code of this product, you will need a text editor. There are a wide range of text editors out there that will do the trick. We used Sublime Text and VSCode to build the framework and template, so we definitely recommend them.

#### Email Service Provider Integrations

The product includes dedicated integrations for the following email service providers:

- Shopify
- MailChimp
- StampReady
- Campaign Monitor
- Mailster for WordPress

With the exception of Shopify, each of these services offers an online email builder that you can use to visually build your layouts. We recommend StampReady, simply because it's the best in class and you can export your layouts to use with other services. If you're using WordPress, the recommendation is obvious.

#### Email Testing
After you customize the template to suit your needs, always test before sending out an email. Our email templates and framework have been tested with Email on Acid, but you can also use the very popular Litmus.

If you don't have access to a testing tool, at the very least send yourself a test email before launching a campaign, and check it on as many devices and email clients as you can. And whatever you do, never send out a mass email from your personal Gmail or Outlook.
