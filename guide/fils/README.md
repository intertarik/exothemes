# File Structure

## How the template is organised

The product has the following folder structure:

<Folder />

The Documention folder contains HTML documentation file avalible offline, the design folder contains the adobe XD file.

The files folder contains forlders for each esp (mailchimp, campain Monitor, stampready HTMl ...)

Notes:

1. HTML and MailChimp versions don't have an all-in-one, pre-built layouts are provided instead. In MailChimp's case, it's also impossible to provide an all-in-one: we've tested it and it's not supported, their editor crashes.
2. The ``shopify`` folder contains only the pre-built, Shopify-integrated templates.

## The Grid

Also as a convenience, the product includes grid examples from our framework. If you want to learn more about using the grid, please refer to the [framework documentation](https://docs.thememountain.com/pine/grid/).
